# Feb 26, 2026: Data processing and proposal update

## Agenda
1. Show Bessie the initial diversity analyses for Aim 1  
2. Review proposal  
3. Discuss how to infer importance of metadata categories from alpha diversity metrics  
   - (We decided in the proposal that Aim 1 will shift from “choosing metadata categories” to “scanning how metadata influences diversity.”)

## Update on the project
- Began preparing R scripts for diversity analyses
- Continued refining the approach for Aim 1 (alpha diversity + metadata influence)

## Discussion notes
- We confirmed that the goal of Aim 1 is now exploratory: identify which metadata categories affect alpha diversity rather than choosing specific metadata upfront.
- Need to check diversity for compaction effects.
- Continue reviewing proposals and align plan before next meeting.
